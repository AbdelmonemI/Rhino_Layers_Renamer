# Rhino_Layers_Renamer

This Python script automates the process of renaming layers in a Rhino file with a numbered naming sequence. It's designed to improve the organization and readability of CAD files, especially when linking them into Autodesk Revit.

## Usage

1. Open Rhino and load the Python script.
2. Run the script, and it will automatically rename all layers with sequential numbers appended to their names.
3. Save your Rhino file with the newly renamed layers.

## Why Use This Script?

- **Better Organization:** The script ensures that CAD layers are named in a consistent and sequential manner, making it easier to manage and understand the structure of the file.
- **Enhanced Revit Compatibility:** By standardizing layer names, Revit can more accurately interpret and control the visibility of linked CAD files, leading to smoother workflows and improved collaboration.

## Requirements

- Rhino 3D software with Python scripting enabled.
